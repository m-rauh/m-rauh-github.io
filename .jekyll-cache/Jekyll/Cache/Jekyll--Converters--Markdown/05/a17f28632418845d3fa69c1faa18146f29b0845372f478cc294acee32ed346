<p>Before breaking down what is Hash and how to implement it, let’s understand where it’s applicable and why.</p>

<p>Imagine you’ve arrived at a city with a mission of delivering a package to a person named Frank Zappa. You have no prior knowledge of where he lives or any information that could help you find where to delivery the package. Your only option would be knock on every door of every apartment of every building, until you find <em>Frank Zappa</em>. If that sounds harsh, you can picture how this task would be nearly impossible in cities with millions of people such as São Paulo, Jakarta, New York or Tokyo.</p>

<p>Even if you had a list with each person’s name and their adresses, you would still have to search for <em>Frank</em> in this list among millions of other names. A computer faces a similiar problem when retrieving info from large databases.</p>

<p><strong>Hash</strong> helps getting around this. Imagine instead, with only a person’s name you could do a mathematical manipulation and arrive at this person’s address. No matter who, you would be able to use the same mathematical function. That’s the proposal of a <strong>hash</strong>, going straight to the info’s source without having to search for it.</p>

<p>Of course, that’s not the only porpouse. It could be used to retrieve and join information faster, to quicly match an input with a database (for example biometric entry systems), to make a search mechanism and more.</p>

<p>So, what is <strong>Hash</strong>?</p>

<p><strong>Hash</strong> consists of reorganize the information of given data structure so that the location of the data is correlated with the data’s key (such as the name, id or value). Therefore, it’ll result in creating a function that transforms the key into a location.</p>

<p>Continuing our example, our transformation could be as simple as converting <em>‘Frank Zappa’</em> to decimal. As in:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Converting from characters to Decimal
F=102 R=114 A=97 N=110 N=107 	==&gt; Frank = 10211497110107
Z=122 A=97 P=112 P=112 A=97	==&gt; Zappa = 1229711211297
Frank + Zappa = 10211497110107 + 1229711211297 = 11441208321404

</code></pre></div></div>
